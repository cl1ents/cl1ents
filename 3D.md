# 3D Modelling portfolio

Welcome to my 3D modelling portfolio!<br>
If you've been led here through a link, [you can learn more about me with my README.md](README.md)!

I've been learning 3D modelling on my own since February 2022.<br>
The main reasons why I started was through curiousity, and generally wanting to add more Tools to my game, [TTD 3](https://ttd3.qts.life), therefor most of my creations are made for and polished with Roblox!

## Software

+ [Blender 3.2.1](https://blender.org)
+ [paint.net](https://getpaint.net)
