# Helo! 🤟🏽

I'm evan ([they/them - il/elle](//pronouns.page/@evn)), a 17 year old French enby, otherwise known as client, cli, evpn, evⁿ or mrep on the web 👀

I'm a general technology enthousiasist that tends to hyperfixate on everything that is computer related.<br>
Currently, I'm into programming, vidya (Mainly *Roblox*, *Counter Strike: Source*, *Movement* and *Rhythm* games), animating, 3D modelling, and designing!

If you wish to simply contact me, please visit my [landing page @ ev.omg.lol](//ev.omg.lol) to check out my (public) socials, otherwise feel free to email me @ `ev@omg.lol` or `gh@cli.lol`!

# I'm currently... 🕵🏽

+ Tech lead, Creative lead & Co-Owner @ [Emotes CO.](//ttd3.qts.life)
+ Brand runner & Co-Founder @ [cofi ☕](//cofi.qts.life)
+ Learning about the wonders of Virtual Reality

# Skills & Tools ⚙

I actively work using the following programming languages:

+ <img height=18px src="https://luau-lang.org/assets/images/luau-88.png"> **Luau** and <img height=18px src="https://www.lua.org/favicon.ico"> **Lua**, both of which I have been using heavily since 2016, I'm very fluent in both languages and am still actively learning the deep quirks of both (mainly Luau at this point),
+ <img height=18px src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2.svg"> **JavaScript**, which I mostly use alongside Node.JS for projects that are off of Roblox,
+ <img height=18px src="https://www.python.org/favicon.ico"> **Python** is honestly not my favourite language by a long shot, but I'm fairly efficient in it as I've had (and will still have) to use it throughout my education,
+ Rather rarely with <img height=18px src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/C_Sharp_wordmark.svg/1920px-C_Sharp_wordmark.svg.png"> **C#**, it is a very nice language to use, and I can still do problem solving using said language, but at the moment, it isn't the language I use the most.

As for visual languages, I'm fluent in Markdown & decent at HTML.

I plan to learn more languages in the future, specifically Rust & Go.<br>
My main IDE **is Visual Studio Code**, but I use **nano** and **Kate** for small projects, and **Roblox Studio** for everything Roblox related.
